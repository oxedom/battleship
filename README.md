# Battleship

The main goal of the Battleship was to practice Test Driven Development & Jest.

This was valuable as I got to practice implementing the logic of the game using Jest and did not have to rely on creating a UI or
consolelogging statements. Apart from this, I got to practice for time building components with Vanila JS, using webpack, PubSub pattern, Game State and more...

Jest is pretty awesome, it helps you POC functions incredibly quickly and too be honest without it I don't think I would of manged to build this project bug free!

This project was one of the most diffcult ones yet, I almost gave up and left it unfinished but I put in way too much time and effort to quit ,so I decided to do a massive refactor, (Which turned into another refactor a few days later) and mananged to get the game working properly.
There are some UI things that could be added but too be honest I've had enough interacting with the DOM using Javascript's API.
Can't get stuck on this thing forever! Cough DragAPI Cough

Your welcome to go through the git history to see how the project took it's shape (TEST's first!)
Some tests were deleted after refactoring but they exist in the git history :)
