In this project, the main goal was to practice using Test Driven Development. 
This was valuable as I got to practice implementing the logic of the game using Jest and did not have to rely on creating a UI or 
making many console.log statements. Apart from this, I got to practice for one final time building components with Vanila JS, setting up a project 
with webpack and prettier. 

One more thing was that I practiced creating a consistent comment structure for my files. Really excited what I came up with.
This was a really great project! It was one of the most diffcult ones yet and I almost gave up but I really felt that I put in way too much effort to just 
continue with the curriculum. A lot of refactoring, slamming my head on the keyboard and fustration, but I guess that's part of the job...
