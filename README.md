# Battleship

This is a web-based implementation of the classic board game, Battleship. The goal of the project was to practice Test Driven Development with Jest, while implementing the game logic using Vanilla JavaScript, the PubSub pattern and OOP.


The game can be played by two players, who place their ships on a 10x10 grid and take turns guessing the location of the other player's ships. The game is won when one player sinks all of their opponent's ships.
